config JSON_LIBRARY
	bool "Build JSON library"
	help
	  Build a minimal JSON parsing/encoding library. Used by sample
	  applications such as the NATS client.

config RING_BUFFER
	bool "Enable ring buffers"
	help
	  Enable usage of ring buffers. This is similar to kernel FIFOs but ring
	  buffers manage their own buffer memory and can store arbitrary data.
	  For optimal performance, use buffer sizes that are a power of 2.

config BASE64
	bool "Enable base64 encoding and decoding"
	help
	  Enable base64 encoding and decoding functionality

config SYS_HEAP_VALIDATE
	bool "Enable internal heap validity checking"
	help
	  The sys_heap implementation is instrumented for extensive
	  internal validation.  Leave this off by default, unless
	  modifying the heap code or (maybe) when running in
	  environments that require sensitive detection of memory
	  corruption.

config SYS_HEAP_ALLOC_LOOPS
	int "Number of tries in the inner heap allocation loop"
	default 3
	help
	  The sys_heap allocator bounds the number of tries from the
	  smallest chunk level (the one that might not fit the
	  requested allocation) to maintain constant time performance.
	  Setting this to a high level will cause the heap to return
	  more successful allocations in situations of high
	  fragmentation, at the cost of potentially significant
	  (linear time) searching of the free list.  The default is
	  three, which results in an allocator with good statistical
	  properties ("most" allocations that fit will succeed) but
	  keeps the maximum runtime at a tight bound so that the heap
	  is useful in locked or ISR contexts.

config PRINTK64
	bool "Enable 64 bit printk conversions (DEPRECATED)"
	help
	  Replace with CBPRINTF_FULL_INTEGRAL.

config PRINTK_SYNC
	bool "Serialize printk() calls"
	default y if SMP && MP_NUM_CPUS > 1
	help
	  When true, a spinlock will be taken around the output from a
	  single printk() call, preventing the output data from
	  interleaving with concurrent usage from another CPU or an
	  preempting interrupt.

config MPSC_PBUF
	bool "Multi producer, single consumer packet buffer"
	select TIMEOUT_64BIT
	help
	  Enable usage of mpsc packet buffer. Packet buffer is capable of
	  storing variable length packets in a circular way and operate directly
	  on the buffer memory.

if MPSC_PBUF
config MPSC_CLEAR_ALLOCATED
	bool "Clear allocated packet"
	help
	  When enabled packet space is zeroed before returning from allocation.
endif

config REBOOT
	bool "Reboot functionality"
	select SYSTEM_CLOCK_DISABLE
	help
	  Enable the sys_reboot() API. Enabling this can drag in other subsystems
	  needed to perform a "safe" reboot (e.g. SYSTEM_CLOCK_DISABLE, to stop the
	  system clock before issuing a reset).
