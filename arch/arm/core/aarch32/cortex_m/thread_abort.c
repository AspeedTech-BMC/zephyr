 * @brief ARM Cortex-M k_thread_abort() routine
 *
 * The ARM Cortex-M architecture provides its own k_thread_abort() to deal
 * with different CPU modes (handler vs thread) when a thread aborts. When its
 * entry point returns or when it aborts itself, the CPU is in thread mode and
 * must call z_swap() (which triggers a service call), but when in handler
 * mode, the CPU must exit handler mode to cause the context switch, and thus
 * must queue the PendSV exception.
