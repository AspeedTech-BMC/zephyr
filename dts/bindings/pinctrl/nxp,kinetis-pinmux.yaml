      NXP Kinetis Pin data.  A series of child nodes that describe each pin
      configuration supported by the SoC.  Each node is expected to named as
      follows - <periph>_<signal>_pt<port><pin>

      The node will have a matching node label that board dtsi files can
      utilized to reference in pinctrl-<N> properties.

      The following is an example for UART0 CTS signal on pin 0, with mux
      value of 2.

      uart0_cts_pta0: uart0_cts_pta0 {
           nxp,kinetis-port-pins = < 0 2 >;
      };

          The array is expected to have two elements. The first element is the
          pin number and the second element is the mux value (i.e. PCR[MUX]).
