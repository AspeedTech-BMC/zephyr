description: Bosch m_can CAN-FD controller

compatible: "st,stm32-fdcan"

include: bosch-mcan.yaml

properties:
    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: false
      description: |
        GPIO pin configuration for CAN signals (RX, TX). We expect
        that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.

        For example the can1 would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&fdcan1_rx_pa11 &fdcan1_tx_pa12>;
