        PIO pin configuration for Timer Counter signals.  We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.

        In Quadrature Decoder mode TIOA0 & TIOB0 signals are expected

        For example the TC0 on SAME7x would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pa0b_tc0_tioa0 &pa1b_tc0_tiob0>;
