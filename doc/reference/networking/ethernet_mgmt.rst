Overview
********

Ethernet management API provides functions to manage the Ethernet
network interface low level status. The caller of these functions can:

* raise ``carrier ON`` or ``carrier OFF`` management events
* raise ``VLAN enabled`` or ``VLAN disabled`` management events

Typically the ``carrier OFF`` event would be generated by the Ethernet
device driver when it notices that the Ethernet cable is disconnected.
The ``carrier ON`` event would be generated if the Ethernet device driver
notices that the Ethernet cable is re-connected.

Currently the VLAN events are generated by the Ethernet L2 layer when a
specific VLAN tag is either enabled or disabled.

The user application can monitor these events if it needs to act
when the corresponding status changes.
