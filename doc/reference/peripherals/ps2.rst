PS/2
####

Overview
********
The PS/2 connector first hit the market in 1987 on
IBM's desktop PC line of the same name before
becoming an industry-wide standard for mouse and
keyboard connections. Starting around 2007, USB
superseded PS/2 and is the modern peripheral device
connection standard. For legacy support on boards
with a PS/2 connector, Zephyr provides these PS/2 driver APIs.
