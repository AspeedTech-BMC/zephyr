	help
	  Synthesize a minimal configuration assuming 256 By page size and
	  standard 4 KiBy and 64 KiBy erase instructions.  Requires the size and
	  jedec-id properties in the devicetree jedec,spi-nor node.

	help
	  The JESD216 Basic Flash Parameters table must be provided in the
	  sfdp-bfp property in devicetree.  The size and jedec-id properties are
	  also required.

	  Read all flash device characteristics from the device at runtime.
	  This option is the most flexible as it should provide functionality
	  for all supported JESD216-compatible devices.

	  Device driver initialization priority.
	  Device is connected to SPI bus, it has to

	help
	  When CONFIG_FLASH_PAGE_LAYOUT is used this driver will support
	  that API.  By default the page size corresponds to the block
	  size (65536).  Other options include the 32K-byte erase size
	  (32768), the sector size (4096), or any non-zero multiple of the
	  sector size.

config SPI_NOR_IDLE_IN_DPD
	bool "Use Deep Power-Down mode when flash is not being accessed."
	help
	  Where supported deep power-down mode can reduce current draw
	  to as little as 0.1% of standby current.  However it takes
	  some milliseconds to enter and exit from this mode.

	  Select this option for applications where device power
	  management is not enabled, the flash remains inactive for
	  long periods, and when used the impact of waiting for mode
	  enter and exit delays is acceptable.

config SPI_NOR_4BAIT_SUPPORT

	help
	  Most flash part with size greater than 16MB support 4-byte dedicated

	  enter 4-byte address mode in advance.

config SPI_NOR_MULTI_BUS_WIDTH_SUPPORT
	bool "Support SPI dual mode and quad mode"
	help
	  In order to speed up SPI data transmission, it is common to use two or
	  four busses to transfer data.
