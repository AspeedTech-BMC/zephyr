Supported Features
===================

The mps3_an547 board configuration supports the following hardware features:

+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| Interface | Controller | Driver/Component                    |
+===========+============+=====================================+
| NVIC      | on-chip    | nested vector interrupt controller  |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| SYSTICK   | on-chip    | systick                             |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| UART      | on-chip    | serial port-polling;                |
|           |            | serial port-interrupt               |

+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+

Other hardware features are not currently supported by the port.
See the `MPS3 FPGA Website`_ for a complete list of MPS3 AN547 board hardware
features.

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:
``boards/arm/mps3_an547/mps3_an547_defconfig``.

For mode details refer to `MPS3 AN547 Technical Reference Manual (TRM)`_.

Serial Port
===========

The MPS3 AN547 has six UARTs. The Zephyr console output by default, uses
UART0, which is exposed over the Debug USB interface (J8).

Serial port 0 on the Debug USB interface is the MCC board control console.

Serial port 1 on the Debug USB interface is connected to UART 0.

Serial port 2 on the Debug USB interface is connected to UART 1.

Serial port 3 on the Debug USB interface is connected to UART 2.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

MPS3 AN547 provides:

- A USB connection to the host computer, which exposes Mass Storage and
  CMSIS-DAP, and serial ports.

Building an application
-----------------------

You can build applications in the usual way. Here is an example for
the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: mps3_an547
   :goals: build

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board, and you should see the following message on the corresponding
serial port:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! mps3_an547

Uploading an application to MPS3 AN547
---------------------------------------

Applications can be in elf, hex or bin format. The binaries are flashed when
the board boots up, using files stored on the on-board Micro SD card. The
Motherboard Configuration Controller (MCC) is responsible for loading the FPGA
image and binaries.

Connect the MPS3 to your host computer using the USB port. You should see a
USB connection exposing a Mass Storage (``V2M-MPS3`` by default).

The update requires 3 steps:

1. Copy application files to ``<MPS3 device name>/SOFTWARE/``.
2. Open ``<MPS3 device name>/MB/HBI0309C/AN547/images.txt``.
3. Update the ``AN547/images.txt`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   TITLE: Versatile Express Images Configuration File

   [IMAGES]
   TOTALIMAGES: 1 ;Number of Images (Max: 32)

   IMAGE0ADDRESS: 0x01000000 ;Please select the required executable program

   IMAGE0FILE: \SOFTWARE\zephyr.elf


Reset the board, and you should see the following message on the corresponding
serial port:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! mps3_an547
