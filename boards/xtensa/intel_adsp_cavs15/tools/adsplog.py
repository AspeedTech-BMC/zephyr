# Log reader for the trace output buffer on a ADSP device.
#
# When run with no arguments, it will detect the device, dump the
# contents of the trace buffer and continue to poll for more output.
# The "--no-history" argument can be passed to suppress emission of the
# history, and emit only new output.  This can be useful for test
# integration where the user does not want to see any previous runs in
# the log output.
#
# The trace buffer is inside a shared memory region exposed by the
# audio PCI device as a BAR at index 4.  The hardware provides 4 128k
# "windows" starting at 512kb in the BAR which the DSP firmware can
# map to 4k-aligned locations within its own address space.  By
# protocol convention log output is an 8k region at window index 3.
#
# The 8k window is treated as an array of 64-byte "slots", each of
# which is prefixed by a magic number, which should be 0x55aa for log
# data, followed a 16 bit "ID" number, followed by a null-terminated
# string in the final 60 bytes (or 60 non-null bytes of log data).
# The DSP firmware will write sequential IDs into the buffer starting
# from an ID of zero in the first slot, and wrapping at the end.
